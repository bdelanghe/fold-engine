about-fold-engine

Fold-engine is a schema-aware view generator that turns large or unknown JSON
into small, navigable Markdown folds. It treats JSON as a bounded cognitive
surface for humans and for AI contexts, using structured projection and
deterministic navigation rather than infinite trees or dumps.

The project explores cognitive folding through the lens of AI, ADHD, schema,
semantics, and knowledge graphs, with tooling rooted in jq, jaq, and jless.
