# Publish Limitations

This vault should stay compatible with Obsidian Publish. Keep content within
supported formats and avoid patterns that Publish does not accept.

## Compatibility checklist
- Use supported file formats only (Markdown + approved attachments).
- Keep attachment sizes within Publish limits.
- Avoid unsupported plugins or features in published notes.
- Keep vault structure simple and portable (no special filesystem tricks).

Reference: Obsidian Publish limitations.
