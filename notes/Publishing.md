# Publishing

Obsidian Publish is a hosted option for sharing vault content. We can use it as
an alternative distribution path to GitHub Pages, or as a private staging
surface for drafts.

## Considerations
- Publish uses the vault as the source of truth.
- The `.obsidian/` folder stays local; publish focuses on note content.
- We can keep GitHub Pages as the public site and Publish for curated subsets.
- Track Publish limitations to avoid conflicts. See [[Publish Limitations]].
