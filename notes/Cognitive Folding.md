# Cognitive Folding

Fold-engine treats JSON as a bounded cognitive surface rather than an infinite
tree. The goal is to keep attention in a small, meaningful window while keeping
the rest of the set reachable.

## Cognitive anchors
- Working memory constraints (4±1 items)
- Executive function and attention gating
- Determinism over novelty

## JSON lens
- Unknown JSON is still navigable through schema-bound projections.
- jq/jaq select structure; folds bound attention.
