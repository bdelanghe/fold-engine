<h1>publishing</h1>
<p>
  Obsidian Publish is a hosted option for sharing vault content. We can use it
  as an alternative distribution path to GitHub Pages, or as a private staging
  surface for drafts.
</p>
<h2>Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Publish uses the vault as the source of truth.</li>
  <li>
    The <code>.obsidian/</code> folder stays local; publish focuses on note
    content.
  </li>
  <li>
    We can keep GitHub Pages as the public site and Publish for curated subsets.
  </li>
  <li>
    Track publish limitations to avoid conflicts. See <a
      href="/publish-limitations/"
    >publish-limitations</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Alignment</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Lume builds from <code>notes/</code>, matching the vault source of truth.
  </li>
  <li>Keep notes portable: no external dependencies required to read.</li>
</ul>
