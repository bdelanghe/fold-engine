<h1>cognitive-folding</h1>
<p>
  Fold-engine treats JSON as a bounded cognitive surface rather than an infinite
  tree. The goal is to keep attention in a small, meaningful window while
  keeping the rest of the set reachable.
</p>
<h2>Cognitive anchors</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Working memory constraints (4±1 items)</li>
  <li>Executive function and attention gating</li>
  <li>Determinism over novelty</li>
</ul>
<h2>JSON lens</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Unknown JSON is still navigable through schema-bound projections.</li>
  <li>jq/jaq select structure; folds bound attention.</li>
</ul>
