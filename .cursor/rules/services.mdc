# Unfold Service Topology

- Unfold runs as a long-lived HTTP service on port 3000.
- Compose service name is `unfold`; Compose is the runtime manager.
- Test service name is `unfold-test` and runs `deno task test` under the `test` profile.
- Vault content is provided by the `vault` service via the `vault-data` volume.
- Health check is `GET /healthz`.
- Bake is the canonical image build graph; Compose never builds images directly.
